        "text": "that he was god incarnate at that point, but they surely thought that he was wonderful and amazing. and more than that, they truly believe that he loved them much that even at the last supper, we see that the apostle john lays his head on the breast of christ. this super intimate connection that he had with christ, that this was, christ was , he was their brother, but he was also their authority figure. he was the one that was responsible for all of them and everything. and yet he wasn't aloof. he wasn't transcendent. he wasn't missing from their lives. in fact, many times when people talk about why did the disciples go to the end of the earth and were willing to be martyred and all these things, and they say, , because they truly saw him and experienced the resurrection. that part is true. it is true that they experienced the resurrection and they saw him and they testified, but the willingness to die for him, that had to do with the deep existential love that they felt from him. they felt connected and bonded to him. they had that experience of love between themselves and him. i remember many years ago, somebody said that they went to this monastery in england and they met this holy saint and they said, when he came around the corner, they said they felt there was a tsunami of love that was coming out from him. i think sometimes when we think about the love of god, our whole picture of god's love is that it's human love when in actuality the love of god is fire raining down from heaven. it has the, it is the essence of all love in the place of it. no other love can exist. it is the purity of love that cannot be divided or diminished in any way. it is the one thing that every person is desiring and longing for in their life. everyone wants to be loved. and how is it that you can develop into this role as a yourself being a lover of mankind and a lover of your family? you have to go to christ. man does not possess this type of love on his own. i often in my own prayers pray that i would be the rusty downspout. , when the gutters fill up with water, they go down the downspout. i don't think that i have all the love, but i know that christ possesses all of the love. and i pray that i would just be a conduit for that love for the people around me that they would sense the love of christ that is genuinely flowing through. that is how we have to be with our family and with our children, with our wives. it's easy to become tired, to become exhausted in our roles as husbands and as fathers. it's easy to become tired in our life and in the people that we interact with, but we have to know where to go to get the energy and the love and the interconnectedness that we're looking for. we have to dive into our life of prayer with christ. as long as we remain outside of that power, the transformative power of prayer and the energizing power of christ's love, we will remain two dimensional. we will lack that third dimension that is the interconnectedness, that interpersonal connection that we make with the people around us. the two dimensional is i can show up, i can work,",

        "text": "i can put food on the table, i can give you my best instruction on how i think things should be done within the family, but it will never feel satiating to the people around us. many times wives have expressed this to me in many terms that they feel that their husband is there, but that he's amiss. and it's not that he's amiss, it's that he doesn't have what he needs to give to the family. he has to be vulnerable with christ in order to have the courage to be vulnerable with the people around him. and he has to be intimate with christ that he can receive that love from christ and hand it on to the people around him. many times man becomes kind of, , a losery in his experience of life. he misses the existential and kind of the dimension of eternity that we all have to live in because man is created to be an eternal being, to live forever with god, being created in the image of god and his nobility is such that god desires to pour out his divinity into the man that man may pour out the divinity of that love, of that presence of god to everyone around him. this is what christ did with the apostles, with those who followed him, with the merbarian women. he conveyed his overwhelming sense of love and closeness with them and they were bonded and desire to be with him much that when they saw that he was god, they realized the source of all that he was giving to them. and they were willing to transmit that to the ends of the earth, even if it cost them their own life. i pray brothers in your life that you would find christ jesus, that you would find that activated love within you that can only be received from him and that you would open yourselves up and connect and give it to the people around you because we as husbands have this unique role to transmit the love of christ to the people around us. god bless.",
